## ‚ú® Features

This application is built as a single-activity app using a modern Android development stack.

#### Core Functionality
- **Splash Screen**: An initial branding screen that directs users to the login page.
- **Secure User Login**: Users log in with a hardcoded email and password. The system provides feedback for incorrect credentials.
- **Persistent Sessions**: The app remembers the user's login state. If the user is logged in, they are directed to the main menu; otherwise, they are sent to the login screen.
- **Main Dashboard**: A central hub providing navigation to all key features of the application.
- **Logout**: Users can securely end their session, which clears all user data and redirects them to the login screen.

#### User Profile & Data Management
- **User Card Screen**: A non-editable screen that displays a summary of the user's profile, including their full name, email, profile picture, and other personal details.
- **Advanced Profile Settings**: A dedicated screen where users can edit their personal information.
  - **Image Picker**: Users can tap their profile picture to select and upload a new image from their device's gallery.
  - **Editable Fields**: Users can update their phone number, age, and city.
  - **Nationality Dropdown**: A user-friendly dropdown menu (`ExposedDropdownMenu`) prevents input errors by providing a predefined list of nationalities.
  - **Age Validation**: Business logic is implemented to ensure that users must be over 18 years old.

#### Security & Auditing
- **Password Recovery/Change Screen**: A secure form for changing the account password, requiring the current password for verification.
- **Password Change History**:
  - A new screen that displays a complete log of all password changes.
  - Each entry is timestamped and details the user, the old password, and the new password, providing a clear audit trail.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

- **UI**: 100% built with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), Android's modern declarative UI toolkit.
- **Architecture**: Follows a basic MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern.
  - `ViewModel` (`UserViewModel`): Holds and manages all UI-related data and business logic, surviving configuration changes.
  - `View` (Composable Screens): Reacts to state changes from the ViewModel and renders the UI.
- **Navigation**: [Jetpack Navigation for Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) is used to handle all screen transitions in a type-safe way.
- **State Management**: UI state is managed within the `UserViewModel` using `mutableStateOf` and exposed to the Composables as `State`, ensuring a reactive and predictable UI.
- **Image Loading**: [Coil (Coroutine Image Loader)](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) is used for efficiently loading and displaying images, including those selected from the user's device.
- **Dependency Management**: Gradle with the Kotlin KTS DSL.
